# icons

Icon files I have created to fill in gaps in my personal needs. Feel free to use, but don't expect updates or featture requests.

If you think any are partiicularly useful, let me know, and I might submit to [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) or [simpleicons](https://simpleicons.org/)
