# icons

Icon files I have created to fill in gaps in my personal needs. Feel free to use anything you want, but please don't expect updates or feature requests. You're wlcome to ask, but at least don't be offended if I say no :)

If you think any are partiicularly useful, let me know, and I might submit to [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) or [simpleicons](https://simpleicons.org/)
